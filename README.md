# Rock-paper-scissors

I asked chatgpt to give me a coding task:

Task: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
You are tasked with creating a console-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game. The game should allow a user to play against the computer in a series of rounds.

The game should start by displaying a welcome message and prompting the user to enter their name.
After receiving the user's name, the game should display a menu with options to choose rock, paper, or scissors.
The user should be able to input their choice by entering a number corresponding to the menu options.
The computer's choice should be randomly generated.
After each round, the game should display the choices made by the user and the computer, as well as the outcome of the round (e.g., "Rock beats scissors. You win!").
The game should keep track of the number of wins, losses, and ties for the user.
After each round, the game should ask if the user wants to play again. If they choose to continue, the game should return to the menu. If not, the game should display the final score and a farewell message.
The game should handle invalid input gracefully, displaying an appropriate error message and allowing the user to retry.

This is my solution.
